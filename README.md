AutonomousNavigationAlgorithms
==============================

This repo consists of algorithms developed for computer vision and autonomous navigation using Python and simulated on a WebGL simulator using the skulpt Python to JavaScript interpreter.

These files are now completed and have been tested.

There is a basic visual odometry algorithm based on simulated physical markers.
A 1D and 2D PD controllers for simulated autonomous navigation also exist.
A basic Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter have also been implemented for control.

If any bugs still exist please don't hesitate to contact me via  Github.
